## Overview

This is a personal project that aims to analyse the performance of Italian airports in terms of key operational metrics: aircraft movements, passenger traffic, and freight throughput.
By examining historical data - since 2000 - and identifying trends, my goal is to gain insights into the efficiency, capacity, and potential areas for improvement of different airports.  
This document explains the background, the objectives, the methodologies, the conclusions and the tools used. I selected the topic of airports performance because of personal and professional interests within the aviation sector.
